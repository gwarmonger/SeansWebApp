Welcome to Sean Anderson (aka Gwarmonger)'s portfolio web app. 

If you would like to run your own instance of the app, put all directions on your server and change the application/config/config.php file to reflect your server settings. 

There is a database schema file "songstorage.txt" in the root folder. This is SQL that can be used to recreate the database. It also still contains some dummy testing data. 

This is still a very initial release. There will be a more detailed readme in the future. 



All the main files are in the folders models, controllers, views. The config stuff is in the config folders. The rest is framework files and libraries that shouldn't need to be messed with.
